        **WARNING**: This is a destructive operation. The service will no longer be available when scaled down.
        
        **Action**: Scales the deployment down to zero pods.
        
        **Affects**: The frontend service is effectively shut down.
        
        This runbook is designed to be run in non-production environments after hours to remove the nodes hosting
        the service. This removes the cost of hosting the service out of hours.

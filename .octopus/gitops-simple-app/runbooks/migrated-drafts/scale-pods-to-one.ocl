        **Action**: Scales the deployment to one pod.
        
        **Affects**: Frontend service - this will create new pods if the deployment has been scaled to zero.
        
        This runbook is designed to be run in non-production environments during office hours to recreate the pods after they
        were shutdown after hours.
